# The-Allegory-Project-Stack-

The Allegory Landing Page
The website is built upon and bootstrapped with ReactJs. It is a single-page website with smooth scrolling animations and Figma components.
I’ve used React Routers and GSAP for smooth scrolling and its animations.
For styling and designing the website, I’ve used Styled-Components instead of plain CSS.
Used React-Slick for the Carousal.
